# crewAI practice repo

## January 27, 2025

This repository contains the crewAI's [quickstart example](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart). I'm using OpenAI for this one.

I created this repo to see what crewAI was all about and understand how to setup basic AI agents. The quickstart was pretty straightforward. It only took me a couple commands to get started.

While I'm not entirely sure that this is the best framework to build agents with, it's definitely a good starting point. I'll be experimenting with it more to see what it can do and I'll keep adding my thoughts here, as I test this and other similar frameworks (like smol agents) with more projects.
